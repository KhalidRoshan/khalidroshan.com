“Actions speak louder than words.” Said Abraham Lincoln in 1856, but little did he know that in the 21st century, words will be enough to aspire actions, however good or bad they might be. In today's digital world, major social media sites and messaging platforms are increasingly replacing news websites for people who want to take a quick look at the world's here and now.

 

But at the darker side of the coin, these platforms are riddled with fake news and hoax messages. Innocent and gullible people who are new to these platforms tend to believe in them and fall prey to these troublemakers. Even mainstream media sites and channels fail to verify the sources of these and run exclusives on them, further worsening the situation. Some of these include the Nano-chip and 2000 rupee note hoax, the fake image supposedly taken from space of India on the night of Diwali and also the infamous message stating that UNESCO allegedly declaring India’s national anthem as the ‘Best in the world’. These fake forwards, however stupid they look to our eyes, have an impact on the less educated and/or gullible people. Stories like these are enough to stir nation-wide protests, communal riots and even decide election results.

 
To understand the true scale of this problem, let us look at this bizarre piece of news that was reported by the renowned daily ‘The Guardian’. An unverified article that surfaced on a fairly popular news website stating that the Israel government was ready to deploy nuclear forces if Pakistan deployed troops to interfere in the current Syrian crisis. To which, Pakistan’s Defense Minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, started brandishing Pakistan’s nuclear status on Twitter, without even bothering to verify whether the news was genuine. Thankfully, the fire was put out before it spread when the Israel’s Defense Ministry tweeted back to avert the misunderstanding.

This might give an insight about how small misconceptions caused by such news might lead to actions that threaten world peace.


Hence, it is absolutely essential to make people aware of such parasitic forwards and posts. One such step was taken by the Russian Government by charging heavy fines on websites which fail to remove such obviously fake news links and posts. Some simple measures that anyone can take to debunk these fake rumours and posts include, searching the contents of any message or article on Google, spreading awareness about them and the harm they cause to the society and forwarding them to organizations committed for the very same cause and will verify the source of it such as ‘FiB’ and ‘B.S. Detector’ – These are extensions available on the popular internet browser - Google Chrome, which detect fake news stories while you browse the internet.
